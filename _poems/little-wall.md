People will stand and pray to you.  
People will weep at your crumbled edifice.  
They will attempt,
quietly,
to hear the cries that once you hid.  
Like all great,
old walls,
people will wonder at what keeps you standing.  
In sun, or lamplight,
the dust of ages will cover your cold blank face,
and only silence will stare back.  
You, my wall, try to fall,
but I will not let you.  
You will stand for an eternity.  
This one space,
this single bony ridge that scars the earth.

I will keep your memory.  
I will stand in vigil of your faults.  
I will marvel at your making,
and know why.  
Yours is a hard lesson,
taught by misery and tears.  
You, wall,
will stand in memory of remembering,
so that we shall not forget.  
In your weight,
your crushing height,
your penetrating depth,
stand forever, my memory,
and remember your birth.

Bloom for me, wall.  
Like the white lily,
burst forth,
refulgent in your genesis.  
Seeming pure and just,
explode from the earth your existence.  
Write in sun turning shadows
the hours off your life.  
Your history is triumph,
your future, a wall.

You grew in your density,
thick with horror.
Glutton, wall, glutton,
you grew fat and wide and tall.
People slaved at your building,
kneeled at your base,
fingered your shadowed weaknesses,
and felt through you,
a hot, empty light.

In living memory,
you aged eternities in Dachou.  
You hollowed with inner heat.  
In cowering,
you built in Auchwitz.
In others hot, sweaty tears,
your are the cry,
fierce and loud
in the hand that built you,
in the arm that made you,
in the heart that beat black blood.
You who seemed like hope,
have always been.  
And amongst all men.

Shout wall, and scream wall.  

Be silent wall.  
Be silent to my blood.  
Hear! Heart!
Listen, dumb thing,
and hear the word.  
The word un-void
snapped your limbs
and sapped your roots.  
Be silent
and hear our remembering,
for you were not birthed in Birchenwald.  
You lived before.  
The men who built you learned your lessons there.  
You were not imagined in Mauthausen.  
You had lived
and breathed
and stood
and waited
for men to fail,
as you always have.  
You were always there,
My wall,  
You and I,
simbiotics inverted.  
Your birth,
a death;
your explosion, life.  

The cries you once hid,
hide no more.  
The pain you shielded from view
shines once more.  
No death averted,
no malignancy betrayed.  
You are my gift,
little wall,
to all the world,
that by not being present,
you give all the more.
