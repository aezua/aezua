Curate for me this long, metallic reed,
Used to write the long hidden histories
It has written histories of bright stars
And
Hollowed then burned through by
Long and hollow, burned through by lapping heat,

Gaze into this sunken kalaidescope,
Its designs mapped, plotted, and  cleaved;
Measure from its bones, the inchoate plan
Of its genesis, from perfection to
Its self-image
Each eye tracing, all who giving, gave more
By knowing less than all. Brave totally
--In sense than light and sound. Brave totally--
Its circumference, to -- dust its recesses--
 --- polish its steel skin. -- long dark screens.--
Shine its dead eyes; peer deeply within them -- that gazing into,--
And bear yourself beyond its ancient aim:
--Will bear you beyond its ancient purpose,--
--Deep into origins mysterious and clear.--
To forge within its furnace heat a light,
Unseen yet brilliant, proptious to our history.
Discover again and again, a thing that always was,
And knowing more than less, sit and be amazed.
