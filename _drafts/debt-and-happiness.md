### Money and Value

-ugh
Let me ask you a very stupid question: What is money?

I have an emotional reaction to money: I know that when I look into my checking
account, I don't see enough of it.  I know that it's quantifiable: I
know that exists in quantities great and small for for persons wealthy
and poor across the globe.  I know it's transformative: I know that
when I spend it, it turns into something else.  I go to a grocery
store, and my money turns into food; I go to a book store, and my
money turns into books.  But really, what is money?

this is a comment that should span a whole parragraph and make itself visible to others


What is money?  That's a pretty stupid question for most people.  They
look in their checking accounts, and know that they don't have enough
of it.  Money is how we measure the world -- what we buy, what we
_want_ to buy, what we sell, what we lend, what we work for -- what we
think will make us happy.  Money stretches across the globe and
touches every nearly aspect of the human endeavor, and its use affects
us in ways we can neither foresee nor control.  Money is a decimal
number that signifies our

One of my favorite examples about the weirdness of money is technology.  Think about your iPhone for a moment (we're going to assume that you have one of these glittering widgets for argument purposes, but anything in this vein will work).   Your iPhone is awesome.  It tethers you to the world in a whole new way.  You don't just call your friends when you want to go out for a drink or talk to your mother on the weekends.  You reach out through the little tiny window into the great, wide internet.  You can visit any web page, see an sight that anyone else can on the internet, and you can do that on a device that fits inside your pocket.  Even cooler, what you can't accomplish on the internet, you can accentuate through custom applications that you can download on your phone.  Want to IM with a person in Chinese?  Want to learn how to speak French fluently?  Want to learn about the latest telescopic discovery?  In Apple's terminology: There's an App for That.  Our fantastic iPhone allows us to reach out to the world -- but how did that happen?

Lots of people know how the Internet was made.  It was originally a project run under the auspices of D.A.R.P.A. (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency).  D.A.R.P.A. did some really cool things to help out technology -- in fact, they're still doing cool stuff.  The one cool thing that brought about the internet was wiring two computers together and making them talk to each other.  That technological achievement, largely unnoticed by everyone in the world, paid for at tax payer expense, was one of the single greatest inventions in man kinds history.  Look around the world now, and every where you go and whatever you do, if you're within sight of a man-made structure, you're looking at something that has been touched in some way by this gigantic intercommunication of computers.

This interconnection is what brings me back to our proverbial iPhone.  The iPhone, like the internet, has hundreds of technological achievements packed within its pocket-sized carriage.  From flash memory to WiFi, hundreds of ideas, mathematical equations, physics experiments, and technicians went into making that single phone.  What's even more remarkable than all of those achievements is that they were all largely unnoticed by the larger public.  Silently to most of us, there is a vast and moving ocean of money and innovation going on in the world.  In fact, that ocean of money is only getting bigger as time goes on.  More people means more technology, which means more people to design and build that technology.  Those people have to be trained and motivated so that they can go out and deliver the next great idea, something that's going to make the iPhone look like the horse-and-carriage of the 21st century.

Money is pumping like blood through the veins of research, industry, the globe, but to what end?  How does this tiny dollar bill explode to be the most functional and versatile unit of measure in the world?  The answer to that question is pretty simple: it makes people happy.  More than any other modern tool, we use money to manage human happiness.  People with lots of money are considered happy; people with no money are considered sad.  There's a lot of anecdotal evidence to back up even these trivial assessments.  Rich people fill their lives with travel and art and all sorts of things we who don't have money largely covet; all over the world, people live in poverty and squalor not because they are lazy or stupid but because the don't have the money to improve their own lives.  The connection between money and happiness is so strong, in fact, you could probably even go farther than a simple causal connection of   Value is the corollary proposition from money, not just what we think will make us happy in the future, but what we are doing now to make that happiness a reality.  Value encompasses that uniquely human ability to plan and perceive the future, and for us to make conscious decisions about how we want to make the world a happier place for ourselves and others.

### Caveats and Warnings

Linking happiness to money is pretty simple to do, but we need to be careful in thinking about the world on the macro level when using this analogyl examination and use of debt.

For some people, notable and history-worthy people, money has been a means to war.  It would be a mistake to equate money with the valued and principled interests of the whole of society in the general happiness of humanity.  The connection between money and happiness in these contexts rests very largely within the minds of those people capable of exorcising that money.  Emperors, Generals, Dictators, and Presidents all construct their own reality of happiness with what they think money can buy.  It would be a dangerous proposition to believe that happiness, in these cases, rests with the explosion of bombs or the slaughter of innocents.  These incidents are almost ancillary to the mind who can conceive of happiness only within their narrow band of knowledge about the world.

We can, from these discussions, make a corollary argument about the nature of money and happiness in the world: we are often extremely poor judges of what will make other people happy.  What seems inconceivable to us is rational and ordered to another.  Their happiness is not our own, and we should not attempt, in trying to discover this deeper world of happiness that binds the world together, to perceive order and intent in a system that is largely driven through the individual happiness of the members that compose that system.

We can, I think, agree that the vast majority of the movement of history has been towards greater and greater happiness of the people on the earth; that money is merely the general reflection of that much distributed and difficult to understand happiness.  We have, over time, moved the world to be a happier place, but often at great and terrible cost to us and our world.  We have often poorly understood the happiness of others -- and ourselves -- within the larger world.  We have paid terrible prices for those mistakes of happiness, but together, we are generally making the world a better place, even if only through trial and error.

### Historical Digressions

In trying to explain what money is and how we should use it to further our happiness, we need to take a historical step back and see how we have used money to understand and cope with the world.  I should begin this digression by stating that I am not a economic expert on history.  Most of what I have learned about the world has been in a haphazard and unstructured way, and my impressions of history's extraordinarily complicated economic processes is, at best, superficial.  However, I think that even some superficial assessments, when placed in context with what we already know about money can get us a long way toward describing the larger world that we see around us today.

First, I would point out what I see as something completely uncontroversial: the world we see around us is largely financed through debt.  Whether a grant from a Queen, backed by Lloyd's of London, or parceled up into Dutch East India Stock, almost every long-reaching financial institution owes at least some small portion of its existence to the creation and management of debt.  Whether that debt is speculative in the case of Queens and Kings, intent upon finding gold in the New World or divvied up and paid back to the buyers in the form of profit dividends, the vast majority of the modern world's economic vehicles arose out of the careful examination and use of debt.

In fact, we can trace much of the life of the Reconnaissance through the life of its banks.  More than the brush of Michelangelo, Florence was made glorious and bright through the industrious application of monetary capitalization, largely through managing and extending the availability of credit.  This is a story told throughout the Renaissance and all over the world where debt was turned into valuable commodities  that could be bought and sold by others around the world.

We can even see in the great perturbations of history when the ability to be a debtor took a significant toll.  The French Revolution wasn't simply a revolution of Democracy, it was a financial rebellion.  People who had nothing, who could neither borrow nor lend in a way that could eventually lead to economic sustainability, eventually rebelled.  The French monarchy was entirely insufficient to the task of creating more complicated instruments to manage its debt.  Under enormous financial strain, it wasn't able to turn debt into roads, bridges, and wheat.  Tellingly, the real birth of the French Franc wasn't under the amorphous and capricious whims of monarchical power, it was fixed under the French Revolution as a means of standardizing a system of relative measures for things.  Debt can only take shape when you can finitely measure an abstract thing like money against a real thing like a loaf of bread or an ingot of iron.

Even more recently, the eruption of Hitler after the first world war was not a natural outcome of the general xenophobia and antisemitism that permeated Europe at the time.  Hitler was largely created through the poor economic decisions following the first world war.  The Allies forced upon Germany extraordinarily difficult economic conditions, making it difficult for individuals to become debtors because the nation itself was already too busy paying off loans to others.  The Allies believed quite wrongly that they could both recoup their war-time losses and choke the life from any nascent, rebellious warmongering through strident economic repression.  Like most ideas that attempt to maximize their happiness at other's expense, it ended badly.  Hitler rode the wave of populist inability to develop proper credit reserves through the vision of the Jew as the consummate money hoarder.  He sold a ghoulish picture of happiness to the German people, painted in the misery of a people they were already predisposed to dislike.  People can be made to do a great many things, both terrible and wonderful, when they are made to fear for their own happiness.

### The Limits of Credit

TODO: Risk

### Recent History

The use of debt as a financial instrument has never been stronger than it is right now.  The economic term of the hour is "Collatoralized Debt Obligations" (CDO), a powerful and, it turns out, incredibly destructive financial instrument that attempts to quantify the risk of debt default within the system.  In essence, it's a betting mechanism who's goal is to make money off of the unhappiness of others.  In an attempt to monetize risk so thoroughly, they made a product that only succeeds when everything else fails.  The securitization of this unhappiness has had extraordinary ramifications for all of us.  Almost everyone living in America knows or knows of a person affected by the failure of these instruments.  They have piled misery upon misery, and we are all left wondering the real utility of these strange and terrible tools.
